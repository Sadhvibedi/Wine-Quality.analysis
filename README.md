#  Wine Quality Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties.

## Objective

To build a classification model that predicts wine quality using features like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol, etc.

##  Dataset

- **Wine Quality â€“ Red** dataset (`winequality-red.csv`)
- Source: Kaggle

##  Model Used

- **Decision Tree Classifier**

## Workflow

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Split into train and test sets
- Train Decision Tree model
- Evaluate with:
  - Classification Report
  - Confusion Matrix

##  Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

##  Conclusion

The model attempts to classify wine into quality categories based on measurable features. It can help producers assess and predict wine quality.
